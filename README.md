qgis-grids-for-atlas
====================

Plugin for QGIS, which generates rectangles with extent of selected print layout which covers selected layer's features. So yo could create print layout for atlas page, then generate rectangles for pages.

Fork of GridsForAtlas QGIS plugin originally created by Experts SIG / Biotope

New features:
* Settings to generated overlapped atlas pages tiles
* References between tiles. (Properties with top, bottom, left, right... page numbers)

Known Bugs:
----------

* Project (and print layout extent) should be in one coordinate system.
